# AI Observability Metrics Summarizer

[Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bXBCL4fbPlRqQxwhGX1p12CS_E6-9oOyFnYSpbQskyI/edit?usp=sharing)

This application provides an interactive dashboard and chatbot interface to **analyze AI model performance metrics** collected from Prometheus and generate **human-like summaries using a Llama model** deployed on OpenShift AI.

It helps teams **understand what’s going well, what’s going wrong**, and receive **actionable recommendations** on their vLLM deployments — all automatically.

---

## Features

- Visualize core vLLM metrics (GPU usage, latency, request volume, etc.)
- Generate summaries using a fine-tuned Llama model
- Chat with an MLOps assistant based on real metrics
- Fully configurable via environment variables and Helm-based deployment

---

## Architecture

- **Prometheus**: Collects and exposes AI model metrics  
- **Streamlit App**: Renders dashboard, handles summarization and chat  
- **LLM (Llama 3.x)**: Deployed on OpenShift AI and queried via `/v1/completions` API

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
- `oc` or `kubectl` CLI configured

---

## Installation

Use the included `Makefile` to install everything:

```bash
make install NAMESPACE=llama-namespace \
  LLM=llama-3-2-3b-instruct \
  LLM_TOLERATION="nvidia.com/gpu" \
  SAFETY=llama-guard-3-8b \
  SAFETY_TOLERATION="nvidia.com/gpu"
```

This will:

1. Deploy Prometheus  
2. Deploy Llama models 
3. Extract their URLs  
4. Create a ConfigMap with available models  
5. Deploy the Streamlit dashboard connected to the LLM

To uninstall:
```bash
make uninstall NAMESPACE=llama-namespace
```

## Using the App

1. Open the route exposed by the `metric-ui` Helm chart (e.g., `https://metrics-ui.apps.cluster.local`)
2. Select the AI model whose metrics you want to analyze
3. Click **Analyze Metrics** to generate a summary
4. Use the **Chat Assistant** tab to ask follow-up questions
